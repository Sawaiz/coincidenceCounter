#Coincidence Counter
The design is an Arduino header that takes up to four analog signals in through a SMA jacks, amplifies and digitizes them and compares them with a four input and gate. The four 
channels can be deactivated individually by a pin header jumper and have individual leds to show hits and a potentiometer to set the threshold value for the comparator. There is a 
digital output of the coincidence as well as a digital output for each of the channels.
